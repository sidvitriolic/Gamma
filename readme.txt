Let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing. 
He knows EXACTLY what he's doing. Barack Obama is undertaking a systematic effort to change this 
country, to make America more like the rest of the world.
That's why he passed Obamacare and the stimulus and Dodd-Frank and the deal with Iran.
It is a systematic effort to change America. 
 
When I'm president of the United States, we are going to re-embrace all the things 
that made America the greatest nation in the world and we are going to leave our children
with what they deserve: the single greatest nation in the history of the world.
